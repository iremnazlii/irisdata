IRIS DATA 
The Iris dataset may be a classic dataset for classification and characterization of plant series machine learning and data visualization.The dataset includes: 3 classes (different Iris flower species) with 50 samples, then four numeric properties about those significiant classes. 
These are Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.
One species, Iris Setosa is "linearly separable" from the opposite two.
This suggests that we are able to draw a line (or a hyperplane in higher-dimensional spaces) between Iris Setosa samples and samples comparable to the opposite two species.
